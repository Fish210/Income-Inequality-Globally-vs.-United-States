# Income-Inequality-Globally-vs.-United-States
This repository focuses on exploring and visualizing global and United States income inequality data from 2010 through 2025. Leveraging publicly available datasets, statistical modeling, and robust visualization techniques, this project aims to uncover the evolution of inequality and predict future trends, accounting for significant historical events like the pandemic's economic impact. Whether you're a policy maker, data enthusiast, or simply curious about the topic, this project offers critical insights into one of society's most pressing issues.

Purpose
The primary goal of this analysis is to shed light on income inequality by visualizing historical data and predicting trends through 2025. The outcomes are designed to inform conversations on economic disparities and their implications for societal development.

Methodology
- Data Collection: The project uses datasets containing income inequality indexes (including Gini index and related measures) for global and U.S. averages from 2010 to 2020.
- Modeling: Linear regression models are employed to predict future trends. Adjustments ensure predictions align seamlessly with the last observed values and reflect realistic increases post-pandemic.
- Visualization: Clear, interactive graphs illustrate comparisons between historical and predicted trends, differentiating between U.S. and global averages.
- Accuracy: Predictions take into account major economic disruptions, wage stagnation, inflation, and uneven recovery efforts, making them both meaningful and realistic.
